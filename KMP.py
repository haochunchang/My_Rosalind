'''
Given: A DNA string s (of length at most 100 kbp) in FASTA format.

Return: The failure array of s.

The failure array of s is an array P of length n for which P[k] is the length of the longest substring s[j:k] 
that is equal to some prefix s[1:kâˆ’j+1], where j cannot equal 1 (otherwise, P[k] would always equal k). 
By convention, P[1]=0.
