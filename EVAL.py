'''
Given: A positive integer n (nâ‰¤1,000,000), a DNA string s of even length at most 10, 
and an array A of length at most 20, containing numbers between 0 and 1.

Return: An array B having the same length as A in which B[i] represents the expected number of times 
that s will appear as a substring of a random DNA string t of length n, where t is formed with GC-content A[i]
